2. **Show for each task:**
   - Title
   - Category (with color)
   - Priority indicator
   - Task image
3. **Filter by category** using a dropdown
4. **Mark tasks complete/incomplete** (PATCH request)
5. **Handle loading states** and errors

### **Technical Requirements**
- Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Vue allowed but not required)
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Use Fetch API or Axios for HTTP requests
